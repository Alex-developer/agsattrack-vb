Installation instructions
=========================


YOU MUST HAVE INTERNET EXPLORER VERSION 5 OR HIGHER INSTALLED BEFORE INSTALLING THIS VERSION.

1) Uninstall ANY previous versions and reboot your computer.

2) Unzip the two zip files into a single directory.

3) run the setup.exe program

From this version all updated will use the Windows 2000 Installer. This has meant that there is NO update
available from previous versions to V1.25, sorry about that.

Problems have been reported using the Windows 2000 installer, it seemed to be overwriting some important system Dll's. I
have installed this version on Windows 98 (se) and Windows ME without any problems. I have NOT verified the installation
on Windows 95.
